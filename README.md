# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Never really written any Read Me files before. I think they are supposed to be what the code
is and how to use it so that is what I will do. (maybe do a little journaling too)

WHAT THIS IS?
    This is a project through the above listed Boot.dev that will be a text file analyzer.
    (Thats about all I know for now)

HOW TO USE?
    python3 main.py (pretty simple)
